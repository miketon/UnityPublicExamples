#Always exclude these files from version control. These files contain editor assets, and runtime-loadable assets - all of which can be #reconstructed by invoking "2D Toolkit > Rebuild Index".
#After updating / getting latest version from version control, make sure to "Rebuild Index". This will rebuild the index and update any necessary #runtime files.
